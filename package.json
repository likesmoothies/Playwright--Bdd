By leveraging the **Page Object Pattern**, **global assertions**, and **custom hooks**, this setup ensures that your automated tests are both **easy to maintain** and **reliable**. Plus, it comes with a **beautifully styled Cucumber HTML Reporter** powered by **Bootstrap** for great visual clarity.",
